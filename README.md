# Portfolio

Built this portfolio site with pure HTML and CSS in an effort to solidify my basic knowledge. The projectr served it's intended purpose but also made me realize just how much more I have to learn in working with these languages.

The layout is mediocre, but in terms of responsivity, it is limited and therefore I will rebuild from scratch with Bootstrap soon :)
