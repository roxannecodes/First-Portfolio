I built this portfolio site with pure HTML and CSS for my first project in responsive web design. 

Unfortunately, the responsivity at screens less than 1024px is limited by the PC-first design--and therefore, the page has to be manually zoomed out after loading on the browser of smaller screens. I plan on rebuilding this from scratch after I learn Bootstrap :)

## Learning Points:
- Discovered the importance of ** moble-first design **.
- Became proficient in ** HTML and CSS. **
- Became familiar with the process of ** version control ** using GitHub.
- Learned how to deploy to a domain (and redirect from GitHub pages)--as well as to register domain with google search results console for indexing.
