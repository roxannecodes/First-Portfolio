# First Project: Portfolio Site

This was my first project EVER!! Although I learned a great deal from it, it's responsivity was limited-- therefore, I rebuilt the site from scratch (visit https://roxfolio.com for updated version).

### Learning Points:
- Discovered the importance of moble-first design.
- Became familiar with the conepts of Responsive Web Design.
- Became more comfortable using CSS,
- Matered the art of version control using GitHub.
- Learned how to deploy to a domain (and redirect from GitHub pages)--as well as to register domain with google search results console for indexing
